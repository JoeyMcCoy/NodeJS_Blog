					<h2 class="section-heading">An Introduction to Node.JS</h2>
					<p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side Web applications. 
					It is a development platform built on top of Google's V8 JavaScript virtual machine. While JavaScript engines 
					(including V8) are traditionally run in Web browsers to form the client side of a client/server application, 
					the Node.js libraries are focused on building server-side applications in JavaScript.</p>
                    <p>
					Code built on the Node platform does not follow the traditional model of receive, process, send, wait, 
					receive. Instead, Node processes incoming requests in a constant event stack and sends small requests 
					one after the other without waiting for responses.  This is a shift away from mainstream models that 
					run larger, more complex processes and run several threads concurrently, with each thread waiting 
					for its appropriate response before moving on.
					</p>									
					<h2 class="section-heading">What Makes Node.JS Different</h2>

                    <p>There are two important things that make Node.js different to existing server-side frameworks:
					asynchronous events and the use of JavaScript as a programming language.</p>
					<h4>Asynchronous Events</h4>
					<p>While most of the existing server side frameworks use a synchronous architecture, Node.js 
					use an asynchronous architecture that JavaScript can handle well. This means that the server 
					reacts to events and send events (messages) to e.g. the database. This style of programming is
					very different than the synchronous style, and may be hard to use with other languages.
					An asynchronous style uses asynchronous IO and can scale well.</p>
					<h4>JavaScript</h4>
					<p>JavaScript is the programming language that web applications use on the client-side. 
					By using the same language on the server-side, the developer can use their JavaScript
					knowledge both on the client and the server, and use the same functions if needed.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Non Blocking I/O</h2>

                    <p>One of the major advantages of Node.js, according to its creator Ryan Dahl, is that it 
					does not block input/output (I/O). Some developers are highly critical of Node.js and point 
					out that if a single process requires a significant number of CPU cycles, the application 
					will block and that the blocking can crash the application. Proponents of the Node.js model 
					claim that CPU processing time is less of a concern because of the high number of small processes 
					that Node.js code is based on.
					</p>						
                    <p>The image below shows the core differences between blocking and non-blocking I/O</p>

					<h2 class="section-heading">In Closing</h2>
                    <p>
					Node.js is really good for applications that wait on I/O and need to handle a lot of concurrent connections.
					The npm (node package manager) is growing quickly with packages such as Bower, Grunt, Express, and many others.
					Even large companies such as Yahoo and Walmart are using Node.js in production.  It has grown and will continue to grow 
					in the next several months.
